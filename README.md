# Easy Reservations w_jQuery

Hello and thanks for trying out my software. This is a mock hotel reservation application that runs on Ruby on Rails with Javascript, now! It still offers ALL those great features of the original Easy Reservations site just with some jQuery and JS upgrades! To highlight some of these improvements now, a user  has the ability to add room reviews, as well as view a hotels rooms immediately, WITHOUT waiting for an new page to load! Gott'a love Javascript! Hopefully these user written reviews can provide a clear picture of what to expect from your desired room! Enjoy my new updated app, you'll never find these rooms at a better price.
