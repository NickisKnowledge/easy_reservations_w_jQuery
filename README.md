# Easy Reservations w_jQuery

Hello and thanks for trying out my software. This is a mock hotel reservation application that runs on Ruby on Rails with jQuery! It offers rooms from two different hotels at exceptional prices. Once you have registered, either through my site or GitHub, you can reserve as many rooms as you want, as long as that room type is available. To add a more realistic feel for the program, I even give you an 'estimated price' for your stay! Enjoy my new SPEEDY app, you'll never find these rooms at a better price!
